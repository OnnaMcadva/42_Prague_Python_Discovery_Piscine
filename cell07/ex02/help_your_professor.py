# • Create a script called help_your_professor.py.
# • It will contain a method called average.
# • This method will take a dictionary as a parameter, associating the students’ first
# names with their scores on an assignment, and calculate the class average for that
# assignment.
# • For example, the following script:

# # your method definition here
# class_3B = {
# "marine": 18,
# "jean": 15,
# "coline": 8,
# "luc": 9
# }
# class_3C = {
# "quentin": 17,
# "julie": 15,
# "marc": 8,
# "stephanie": 13
# }
# print(f"Average for class 3B: {average(class_3B)}.")
# print(f"Average for class 3C: {average(class_3C)}.")

# Will have the following output:

# ?> ./help_your_professor.py
# Average for class 3B: 12.5.
# Average for class 3C: 13.25.
# ?>
